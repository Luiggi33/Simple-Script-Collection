# My Simple Script Collections

These are simple Scripts wich I created out of boredom.
They are not equipped with API Keys, so you need to get your own API Key.

## Where to get your API Key
- FileSorting: No API Key needed
- LyricGenerator: No API Key needed
- MathTrainer: No API Key needed
- RickRollChecker: ```https://www.linkpreview.net/```
- TankerTracking: ```https://www.creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de/```
- URLShorting: ```https://www.cutt.ly/```

## Where to put your API Key
1. Create a config.py
2. Edit it and add ```apiKey = (Your API Key)```
3. Profit
